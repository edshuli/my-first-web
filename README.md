Welcome everybody!

This might be a very easy website to create but I am new,so give me some credits :D

This is actually a part of the learning material for Code Institute's Fullstack Web Developers program.

Please take a look at the website <a href="https://vfs.cloud9.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/vfs/240aa57bcd304781abc38eb563e9d404/preview/index.html">here</a>
